# Kubernetes Provisioning
(Brief) notes relating to Kubernetes cluster provisioning.
The RKE notes relate to creating the small cluster to host a
Rancher deployment. Other directories relate to he formation
of clusters directly (generally on cloud-specific providers like AWS).

Individual directories should have their own `README.md` files.

>   Most instruction assume you're using the project requirements in
    in Conda or a virtual environment.
